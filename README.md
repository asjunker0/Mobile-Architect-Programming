CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming
<br/>
<br/>(From the SNHU CS-340 Syllabus)
<br/>Students will apply mobile development principles and best practices to develop mobile applications using user-centered design principles and industry standards. Upon completion of a fully-functional mobile application, students will conduct security, product assuredness, and compatibility checks before launching the application.

# Course Competencies
This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to the field:
<br/>Apply mobile application development principles and best practices in the development of a mobile application
<br/>Apply user-centered design principles and industry standards in the development of a mobile application
<br/>Develop and launch a fully functional mobile application


# Software and Tools
<br/> Android Studio: Primary IDE for building, testing, and debugging.
<br/> Java: main programming language.
<br/> XML: Used for creating the layout files.
<br/> SQLite Database: Embedded relational database used for local data storage.
<br/> Android SDK & API Libraries: Core Android APIs provide the functionality for UI management, data persistence, and user permissions.


# Project Overview
__Project Summary__<br/>
My Inventory App is a mobile application designed to help users easily track and manage inventory. It allows users to create an account or log in, add new items, update quantities, and delete items when they’re no longer needed. The app uses an SQLite database for secure and persistent data storage and displays all inventory in a clean, grid-style layout. When an item’s quantity reaches zero, the user receives an in-app alert and, if enabled, an SMS notification. The app includes user-controlled SMS permissions and settings for enabling or disabling notifications at any time. It’s simple, efficient, and built to work smoothly on modern Android devices.
